# pve2netbox

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Multi-cluster decommission workflow** — with several pve2netbox instances (one per Proxmox cluster) syncing into one NetBox, a VM missing from Proxmox is no longer deleted when `ENABLE_CLEANUP=true`: after `DECOMMISSION_AFTER_CYCLES` (default `2`) confirmed cycles of absence it is moved to the graveyard cluster `NB_DECOMMISSION_CLUSTER_ID` with `status='decommissioning'`. A `vmid` reappearing in Proxmox (cluster migration or vmid reuse) is adopted back from the graveyard automatically — adopt works always, independent of `ENABLE_CLEANUP`; a `vmid` simultaneously live in another cluster is skipped with an error in the log (migration window / collision). New env vars **`NB_DECOMMISSION_CLUSTER_ID`** (required when `ENABLE_CLEANUP=true`; create the graveyard cluster in NetBox first) and **`DECOMMISSION_AFTER_CYCLES`** (default `2`). Documented in README ("Multi-cluster operation: decommission & migration") and contrib samples (Docker, LXC, systemd).

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`PRIMARY_SUBNETS`** — optional, comma- or whitespace-separated list of subnets used to pick `primary_ip4` / `primary_ip6` for each VM (e.g. `PRIMARY_SUBNETS=192.168.88.0/24, 2001:db8::/64`). Subnet order defines priority: for IPv4 and for IPv6 independently, the first subnet in the list that matches an IP reported by the QEMU guest agent wins. Within a subnet candidate IPs are sorted, so the result is deterministic regardless of the order Proxmox/agent returns interfaces. When the variable is unset/empty, pve2netbox does **not** touch `primary_ip4`/`primary_ip6` (see 1.0.7 below). Invalid subnet are logged and skipped.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Backup-induced changelog noise**: during `vzdump` of a stopped VM, Proxmox briefly reports `status: running` (a helper QEMU is started for disk access), which previously produced `offline → active → offline` entries in the NetBox changelog on every backup. Status is now preserved unchanged while PVE holds a transient `lock` (`backup`, `snapshot`, `migrate`, `clone`, `rollback`); the same condition also prevents quick-check from flagging the VM as "changed". Controlled by new env var **`IGNORE_STATUS_WHEN_LOCKED`** (default `true`).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **Stale VM disks cleanup**: when a disk is moved to another Proxmox storage, its path (NetBox disk `name`) changes and a new entry was previously added without removing the old one. The sync now tracks disks seen in the current Proxmox config and deletes obsolete `VirtualDisk` records from NetBox for both QEMU VMs and LXC containers.

### Changed

- **LXC installer auto-restart on update**: `contrib/lxc/install.sh` now detects already-running `pve2netbox.service` / `pve2netbox.timer` units and restarts them automatically after re-running the installer, so in-place upgrades pick up the new code without manual `systemctl restart`.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Proxmox tag sync to NetBox** — native VM/LXC tags from Proxmox (semicolon-separated in cluster resources) are created in NetBox when missing and assigned to the matching virtual machines together with existing pool tags (`Pool/<poolid>`). New env var **SYNC_TAGS** (default `true`); set `SYNC_TAGS=false` to keep only pool tags. Documented in README, `.env.example`, and `contrib/` samples (Docker, LXC, systemd).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **QEMU guest agent**: when syncing VM interfaces, IP addresses no longer reported by the guest agent are now removed from the interface in NetBox (previously only new IPs were added; stale ones were left).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- VM matching by name+cluster when vmid is missing; sync no longer aborts on single VM/LXC failure; in combined mode, failed initial full sync triggers full retry on next cycle.

### Added

- VM index by `(name, cluster_id)` and per-VM/LXC error handling with clear messages.


## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-14

Project renamed to **pve2netbox** (formerly a fork of [creekorful/netbox-pve-sync](https://github.com/creekorful/netbox-pve-sync) v0.2.4) with extended functionality.

### Added

- **Prometheus metrics** (`ENABLE_METRICS=true`)
  - HTTP endpoint `/metrics` on port 9090
  - Metrics: syncs, VM/LXC counts, errors, duration
- **Structured logging**
  - Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR (via `LOG_LEVEL`)
  - Formatted output with timestamps
  - Context for debugging

#### New features

- **Dry-run mode** (`DRY_RUN=true`) — test without making changes
- **Automatic cleanup** (`ENABLE_CLEANUP=true`) — remove VMs from NetBox that no longer exist
- **Configuration validation** — check required variables at startup
- **LXC container support** (`SYNC_LXC`, `LXC_ROLE`)
  - Sync rootfs, mount points, network interfaces
  - Separate roles for VM and LXC
- **Sync modes**
  - Single-run: one-off sync
  - Simple mode: periodic full sync (`SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS`)
  - Combined mode: quick checks + full sync (`QUICK_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`)

#### Docker

- `contrib/docker/`: `Dockerfile` with health checks, `docker-compose.yml` with full config
- Ready env samples in `contrib/docker/`: `env.single-run`, `env.simple-mode`, `env.combined-mode`

#### Extended Proxmox integration

- **QEMU Guest Agent**
  - Real interface names (eth0, ens18) instead of net0/net1
  - MAC-based matching
  - Correct IP assignment
- **Auto-provisioning** — automatic creation of custom fields and device roles
- **MTU support** for network interfaces
- **Extended disk support**
  - Types: SCSI, SATA, VirtIO, IDE, EFI
  - Sizes: K/M/G/T
- **Conflict handling**
  - MAC/IP: auto-reassign when VM is offline

  - Detailed errors on real conflicts

### Improved

- **Performance**: batch loading from NetBox (~20–30% faster)
- **Reliability**: rate limiting and retry on 502/503/429 (`NB_API_DELAY_SECONDS`, `NB_API_RETRY_*`)
- **Error handling**: contextual messages and graceful degradation
- **Architecture**: modular layout with type hints

### Technical details

Five new environment variables: `DRY_RUN`, `ENABLE_CLEANUP`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `ENABLE_METRICS`, `METRICS_PORT`

## Upstream: [0.2.4] - 02/09/2025

### Added (from previous unreleased section)

- **Combined sync mode** (`QUICK_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`):
  - Quick VM change check every minute (without loading configs)
  - Incremental sync of only changed VMs
  - Full sync every hour for consistency
  - Minimal load on Proxmox and NetBox APIs
  - Recommended for setups with >50 VMs
- `quick_check_changes()` — quick check of VM state (status, name, node, memory, disk)
- `_load_specific_objects()` — load only needed objects from NetBox for incremental sync
- `sync_specific_vms()` — sync only specific changed VMs
- **LXC container sync** (rootfs, mount points, network interfaces).
- Configurable virtualization types: `SYNC_VMS` and `SYNC_LXC` (both on by default).
- **Role configuration**: `VM_ROLE` and `LXC_ROLE` for NetBox Device Roles for QEMU VMs and LXC.
- **Auto-provisioning**: custom fields (autostart, replicated, ha, backup, dns_name) and device roles created in NetBox on first run.
- **MTU support** for VM and LXC network interfaces: MTU from Proxmox synced to NetBox.
- **Improved QEMU Guest Agent**: detect agent (VM running), match interfaces by MAC, use real names (eth0, ens18) instead of net0/net1, correct IP assignment.
- All QEMU disk types: SCSI, SATA, VirtIO, IDE, EFI (`efidisk0`).
- Disk sizes in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), terabytes (T).
- Detailed sync-stage logging for debugging.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate network interfaces** when VM is stopped: look up existing interface by MAC before creating. No more duplicate interfaces (net0 vs eth0) when toggling with/without guest agent.
- **MAC conflict handling** when cloning VMs:
  - On duplicate MAC, check old VM status
  - If old VM **offline** → MAC reassigned to new VM (clear primary on old, set on new)
  - If both **active** → ERROR with conflict details, sync skipped without crash
  - Avoids NetBox error: *"Cannot reassign MAC Address while it is designated as the primary MAC for an object"*
- **IP conflict handling** when cloning VMs:
  - **VRF support**: IPs in different VRF are not a conflict — create new IP in current VRF
  - On duplicate IP in same VRF, check old VM status
  - If old VM **offline** → IP reassigned to new VM (clear primary_ip4/primary_ip6 on old)
  - If both **active** → ERROR with details (VM name, ID, status, interface), sync skipped
  - **VM status check**: correct NetBox status handling (case-insensitive, "Offline" format)
  - Avoids NetBox error: *"Cannot reassign IP address while it is designated as the primary IP for the parent object"*
- **Node status in `sync_specific_vms()`**: use correct Proxmox node status source.
- Reduced NetBox API load: delay between requests (`NB_API_DELAY_SECONDS`) and retries on 502/503/429 (`NB_API_RETRY_*`).
- Excluded PVE system devices (TPM, scsihw, ide2) from disk sync.
- MAC address no longer added to interface Description.
